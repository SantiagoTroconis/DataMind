🧠 DataMind: Natural Language Data EngineeringDataMind is an intelligent web interface designed to bridge the gap between non-technical users and complex data manipulation. By combining the power of Pandas (Python), Plotly, and Large Language Models (LLMs), DataMind allows users to edit, analyze, and visualize Excel/CSV files through simple conversational prompts.🚀 Core PhilosophyThe goal is to eliminate "Excel Friction." Instead of memorizing complex formulas or navigating nested menus to create charts, users simply state their intent (e.g., "Calculate a 10% tax on the price column" or "Show me a bar chart of sales by region"), and DataMind handles the code execution in the background.🏗️ System ArchitectureComponentTechnologyResponsibilityFrontendReact + TypeScriptUser interface, file uploads, data preview (first 20 rows), and interactive chart rendering via Plotly.BackendFlask (Python)API endpoints, Pandas data processing, state management, and AI code execution.IntelligenceAI API (e.g., OpenAI/Anthropic)Translating natural language prompts into executable Python/Plotly code.VisualizationPlotlyGenerating interactive, JSON-based charts for the frontend.🔄 The DataMind WorkflowIngestion: User uploads a .csv or .xlsx file. The frontend displays a 20-row preview.Contextual Prompting: The user enters a change request. The backend sends the prompt to the AI, along with the dataframe schema (column names, data types) and the first 5 rows for context.Intent Classification: The AI determines if the request is a Data Manipulation (Pandas) or a Data Visualization (Plotly).Safe Execution:Updates: Backend executes the generated Pandas code using a restricted exec() environment.Charts: Backend executes Plotly code and returns a JSON-serialized figure object.Synchronization: The frontend receives the updated dataframe preview or the interactive chart and updates the UI accordingly.🛠️ Key Technical Features1. Dual-View InterfaceTo maintain focus on the "Source of Truth," the UI uses a split-screen approach:The Table (Main): A constant view of the data.The Insights Sidebar: A sliding panel that hosts AI-generated charts and "History of Changes" logs.2. State Management & Undo LogicDataMind maintains a Command Stack. To ensure efficiency:Instead of saving multiple versions of a large file, the system stores the Initial Dataframe and a List of Python Commands applied to it.Undo: The system re-applies $n-1$ commands to the original file.Revert: Clears the command list and restores the original upload.3. Interactive VisualizationsInstead of static images, DataMind uses fig.to_json() in Flask. This allows the React frontend to render charts that users can:Hover over for specific values.Zoom and pan.Toggle data series on/off.📋 The "Brain" (System Prompt Logic)The AI is instructed to return a structured JSON response to ensure the backend can parse the intent:JSON{
  "intent": "UPDATE" | "CHART",
  "explanation": "Briefly describe what the code does.",
  "python_code": "The executable pandas/plotly code.",
  "error_handling": "Fallback logic if columns are missing."
}
🗺️ Development Roadmap[ ] Phase 1 (MVP): File upload, Pandas code execution, and basic table refresh.[ ] Phase 2 (History): Implementation of the Undo/Redo stack and change log.[ ] Phase 3 (Visuals): Integration of Plotly for automatic chart generation based on user intent.[ ] Phase 4 (Safety): Hardening the Python execution environment (Sandboxing).[ ] Phase 5 (Presets): "Magic Wand" buttons for common tasks (e.g., "Clean duplicates," "Format dates").
